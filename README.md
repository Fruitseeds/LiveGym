# LiveGym
Project by Ayman Taleb and Jonathan Zahavi
CS 426 - Internet Of Things

Internet of Things class final project. Gyms and fitness centers lack accurate real-time status on both occupancy and member verification. To address these issues, we propose LiveGym, a system that performs passive BLE scanning on a Raspberry Pi Zero W to detect and identify gym members at the building entrance.
